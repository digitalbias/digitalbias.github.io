Rift Walker is a work of fiction that has been bouncing around in my head ever since I saw the [cover][hero_cover] Keith Parkins did for a book called ["Son of the Hero"][hero]. I didn't know the name of the name of the book, but the image intrigued me and I started making a story behind it and the [cover art][varay_cover] for [the book][varay] that was clearly the sequel.

I finally made something of an outline for the book, but never got very far in writing it until February of 2016. It was then that I started my habit of daily writing. You can see a part of my logs as I began to work on it, progressed through a bit of a drought, but then really began working on it in earnest.

This is what my log looked like in the beginning.

|Date |# words |

|2014 Nov 3|420|
|2014 Nov 4|920|
|2014 Nov 5|152|
|2014 Nov 6|213|

Then, a little later it evolved a bit more to be like this
