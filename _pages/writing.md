Since high school, I've been writing various works, primarily science fiction, fantasy, and superhero stories, alongside non-fiction. I recently earned an honorable mention from Writers of the Future, a significant milestone in my writing journey. I've only submitted work once before, as part of an assignment, but I'm now focused on sharing more of my writing.

Below are my current projects, with monthly updates to keep this page fresh. I also plan to write an article detailing my writing tools, process, and habits.

## Past Projects

### Imperial Champion

**Single sentence description**: A fantasy thriller about a young man framed for the emperor's murder, fighting to prove his innocence.

Started in Brandon Sanderson's 2013 BYU writing class. Wrote 50% but hit a plot snag. Plan to revisit after Rift Walker's first edit, reassess, and continue drafting.

### Change Reaction

**Single sentence description**: A sci-fi/superhero story about a college freshman entangled in corporate suppression and human augmentation.

Conceived with friends in high school, co-wrote chapters, and later revisited for NaNoWriMo 2004. Needs significant revision, with summarized sections requiring full scenes. Will tackle after Rift Walker and Imperial Champion, targeting ~80,000 words.
