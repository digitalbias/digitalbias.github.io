# Under Construction

This page is under construction. The idea behind this page is a place where I can stick reviews and thoughts about games I've played as well as what I'm looking forward to from a games coming out. Also sports. Impressions and thoughts. All the things that don't fit under business and outdoors. Could also include tinkering projects like messing around with Raspberry PIs, 3D printers, VR and other things that don't have a direct relationship with business.

I know. Some of those things may cross lines. Here's an example of what you could expect: If I write an article about using a Raspberry PI to host a database and use it to track user metrics. That would be under business.

If I do something with a Raspberry PI like making a game console or hosting a media server at home: That's play.

Hope that helps.
