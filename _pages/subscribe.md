I do a number of things, but one of the things I've done since High School is write. If you are interested in reading my fiction or some of the non-fiction I will be writing over the coming years, then I suggest you subscribe to my newsletter. I'll send you the first chapter of my current project and you'll be one of the first people to hear when I publish.

I also intend to use people on my email list as <del>victims</del> <del>test subjects</del> beta readers for projects that are getting ready for a more general release. If you like what I have out there and are interested in getting more, then get on the list. But get on sooner than later. I'll only be asking for beta readers once and  I only want to have about six.
