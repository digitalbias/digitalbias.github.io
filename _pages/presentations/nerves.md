## It Takes Nerves (OpenWest 2019 Submission)

Single board computers like the Raspberry Pi and the BeagleBone are opening up the possibilities for more people to get involved in not only software development, but also making it possible for people to create their own hardware systems. In this session we'll talk about how you can use a high-level language like Elixir and with the Nerves Project create useful devices you can take home or to work to make your live easier.
