Since I was in High School I've been writing one thing or another. I've only submitted to have anything I've written once, and that was because it was part of the assignment, however, I'm looking to change that.

I mostly write science fiction and fantasy, with some super-hero stuff thrown in for good measure. However, I also enjoy writing non-fiction. Below you can see what I'm currently working on, and when I have time, I'll post another page with past works in case somebody wants to read the terrible stuff I've written in the past.

I'd also like to write up an article on what I use and how I do my writing. Tools, process, habits. In other words "the works".

## Current Projects

Below you can see what I'm currently working on and where they are at. I'll update these every month, just to keep this fresh.

**Last update:** 2016 May 14

### Rift Walker
