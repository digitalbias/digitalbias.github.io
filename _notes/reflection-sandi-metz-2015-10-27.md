# Sandi Metz Presentation, Day 2

## Flocking Rules

Shamless Green is... 
- wonderful
- Has immense value
- Antidote for seasoned developer is apt to do
- Don't worry about DRY/refactoring, before getting all the requirements
- It's a starting point
- Horizontal vs Vertical: Avoid detours and just work the current problem
- "Quick Green Removes All SIn"
- Stay out of the red

### Rules
Find things that are most alike
Identify the smallest difference betwen them
Take the smallest change to remove the difference
Delete unused code

### Open/Closed
Open for modifications
Do you know how to make it open
Look for code smells
Heal the easiest piece

- Helps get people to a centered approach
- We cannot be too far on "Rigid Structured approach" or too far on the "Cowboy" either
