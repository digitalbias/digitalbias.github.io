While there are only three necessary processes for being productive, there are other which are still necessary if you want to operate at your peek performance. The next most important is the review.

There a couple of different reviews which can be performed as part of a productivity system. They are daily, weekly and yearly. Sure there are other timeframes which can be used, and some may be more preferable to others, but the three most common are the daily, weekly and yearly reviews.

Each review has its purpose and place in a framework.

A daily review has two main goals:

1. To review the past days activities
2. Plan the activities for the following day

Some people may even break this up into two different meetings, but I have found that the best use of time and energy is to hold just one meeting. This allows you to see where you would like to improve and make plans for it while planning the activities for the following day. The daily review can be held at either the beginning or the end of the day, however the end of the day is better because the events of the day are fresh in your mind and the review is easier. Also, sleeping on the plans you have for the next day can help you assimilate it and allow for the unconscious mind to work on it throws you can hold. A week is just enough time to make significant progress on goals while still being a timeframe you can grasp. Anything longer than a week starts to get fuzzy and more difficult to manage. Goals that are broken down into week long sizes are more likely to succeed than those which are just broken down into months of even quarters.

Inevitably you end up working on those goals when it gets close to the deadline instead of working on them every day or achieving milestones every week. Doing a weekly review also gives you the opportunity to take a moment and make adjustments to the process itself. You can goo back and look at the daily reviews and the insights you have had each of those days and then plan for specific changes you want to make to the process. Things like when to do the daily review what to make a part of that daily review, what things to do in the morning or the evning when it is not a daily review (like just reading through the plan for the day). As you look over other people's ideas, you can decide in the weekly review if its something you wnat to make a part of your own routine. Determine how long you are going to experiment with that pratice and then when that time is up, review it in the weekly review to see if that is somethign you still want to do. The weekly review is more of the stratigic planning time, while the daily review is more tactical.

If the daily review is where the tactical planning occurs and the weekly review is where you make your strategy, then the yearly review is the place where the visionary items are concieved and planned.

Many people are in the habit of making new years resolutions. I'm not that fond of the pratice but like the idea of setting goals and working toward them. DOing that on an annual basis is appropriate, but it doesnt' work as well unless you break it down and have regular reviews on either a quarterly or monthly basis. If you decide to hold an annual review, make sure to schedule regular monthly or quarterly reviews to help keep you accountable to those yearly goals and to help you make sdjustments throughout the year as needed so you can still hit that goal.

While reviews are not a necessary paret of a producitibvy system, they can help provide feedback on the system itself and help provide times and oppriotinuityes to make adjustments to the overall plans you mayu have. In this way to don't juet get thigns done, but also make a bigger impact in what you do. You won't feel like a hampster on a treadmill; but isntaal feel like you are making a differentce and that the tasks you re doing have more mreaning instead of just checking off a box.
