In my strategy class, one of the things that stuck with me was learning to ask the right questions. There are times when you can dig up really interesting facts and ideas with the questions you ask. If you don’t ask the right question you will never get to that kernel or insight. Some of the most impactful occurrences in history are due to the questions people have asked.

Take, for example, Issac Newton. While there are some doubts as to the validity of the story about him sitting under the apple tree and having his head hit by it, but the idea is this: He could have been like anybody and gotten hit on the head by an apple and thought nothing of it, but instead asking the question: “What is it that makes apples fall to earth?” has opened up science and engineering to a host of other questions. It was that question which has lead to so many other discoveries.

Not all questions, however, are of equal value. “What should I have for breakfast?” is much more mundane and not likely to swing the hinges of scientific discovery very much. A related question, however, might. “How does the nutritional value of this food impact my performance today and over time?” While not as pivotal as Sir Issac’s question, it is still a much more impactful one than the previous question.

The question is (no pun intended) what can we do to develop a habit of asking good, meaningful and thought provoking questions?

Practice is certainly one method. Having a curious mind is another. Changing our thought patterns is another. As our mind focuses on learning the secrets of the universe, both things in the earth and above it as well as what motivates people, we will find our questions improve and our learning and knowledge will also increase.

The real question now is “What are you going to do to improve the kinds of questions you ask?”
