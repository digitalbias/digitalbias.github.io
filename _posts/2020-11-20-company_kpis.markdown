KPI’s stands for key performance indicators. KPI‘s are typically used to measure critical activities that happen within a company or other organization. They can even be used to measure an individual’s performance on key tasks that they have.There are varying opinions on their effectiveness and utility, but at the same time it really depends on the organization and the people who are utilizing them. In some cases they can be a very big stick with unrealistic expectations while on the other hand they can be a motivating factor that helps people keep focused on the things that are most important is in a company. Most critical part of KPI‘s he’s not measuring but rather in deciding what is most important and how those activities will be measured and that happens long before you start displaying them on some kind of dashboard.
For our company one KPI was really obvious but the other two were not. It took about a month and a half to two months before we came up with them and it’s been almost 2 1/2 months before we’ve managed to find all the places where we can get the data to report on them.
Our first one is revenue per tech per day.Technicians are the driving force and everything that we do and having them be productive and bringing in money to the company is the lifeblood of the company and so first KPI was pretty straightforward. If we can keep them busy and productive then we will do well.
The next KPI was contacts made per day. Answering phones and following up with people helps keep our technicians busy helps keep our customers happy and ultimately helps us to service more people. Contacts per day helps to measure that.
The final KPI his focus more on efficiency and making sure The most important asset we have within the company is producing the thing that keeps the company of life. In our case that measure is revenue divided by payroll. That’s not necessarily something you could measure every day but you can come pretty close you can basically say the number of hours worked by everybody and take their salary or their wage divide that into the revenue that you have and come up with a number you can track to make sure you are being productive. 
I’m sure that as we grow and progress as a company we will make adjustments to these numbers and possibly use different numbers and measures to focus on the things that are more important in the future, but for now these are the ones that make the most sense for us and help us focus on our primary goals.
