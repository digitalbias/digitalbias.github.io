## Writing and Coaching Update
*October 19, 2025*  

Big news! My website’s updated with the latest on my writing projects. I’ve finished first drafts for two new books, making seven works in progress. I’m thrilled to announce I won a short story contest—a huge milestone! Beyond writing, I now offer business coaching to help professionals succeed in their careers and finances. Check out the project updates on my site and follow me on Instagram (@digitalbias or @biasedpublishing) for more!
