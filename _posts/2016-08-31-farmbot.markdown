There have been a number of interesting technologies I've seen this month, but the most interesting thing I've seen has been the [farmbot][farmbot]. Interchangeable attachments, it waters, weeds, and plants the food. Apparently you can control it from a remote computer and you can 3D print many of the pieces yourself if something fails. It's a cool bit of engineering and technology using the [RasberryPi 3][pi] along with other components.

Would I get one?

No.

At $3,000 it's more of a curiosity for me and I marvel in the thought that has gone into it. However, it's not a product I would actually buy. I just don't have the space, time or inclination to maintain something like this, but I think it's kind of cool. Kind of along the lines of [aquaponics storage container structures][containers].
