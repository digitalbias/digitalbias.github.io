This site runs on something called [Github Pages][ghpages]. For the most part it's a great engine for blog posts and websites in general. I don't have to worry about hosting costs and I can push just about anything I want out there. I have full control over the site and since it's a static site there are no worries about it being too slow.

There is one problem though: I like to schedule posts in advance, but [Github Pages][ghpages] doesn't support that functionality. It's been a thorn in my side for a long time and I've tired before to make this work, but not something that has been robust or stuck.

Finally, fed up with this rigmarole and wanting to post on a more consistent schedule, I've decided to scratch this lingering itch. I read up on the [Github Api][ghapi] and created a [project][project] that solves this problem for me. There is a bit of setup but for people who are a bit more techy, but should be a decent solution nonetheless.

In fact, if you are reading this on January 28th 2017, chances are this entire process worked!

If you decide to use it, let me know. I'd love to hear about it. You can leave a comment below or mention me in a tweet.
