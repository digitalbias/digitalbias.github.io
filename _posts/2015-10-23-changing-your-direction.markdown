There are times in life when you need to take a bit of a break.

There are others when you feel like just walking away.

Other times you just feel like there is something more.

In June of this year I was let go from my job and found myself with some time on my hands. For some of it I looked for a job, but as time passed, I began wondering if there wasn't something more that I wanted to do with my life. I began looking at what I had done and thought about what I wanted to do in the future.

For a while I thought that was technical freelance work, but as I've thought more about it, I've realized what I really want is to teach and help others overcome obsticales and to help solve problems. Some of them may be technical, and I think I can help there. Others are not as technical. I think I can help there too.

So, my wife and I started a podcast, designed to help families become better organized and give our listeners ideas they could use to help their families be more unified. We've released a couple episodes so far, and it looks like it is going well.

But I want to do more than just that.

So, I've decided to change up things on this website and blog as well.

I'm looking to post about a couple of topics here, probably on a rotating basis, but it depends on what ideas for posts I have. The topics I want to talke about here will be around observations, personal development, life, outdoors, software development and running a business. Maybe a bit all over the board, but it's a good set of some of the things I'm interested in and I think with that many topics I'll be able to maintain a regular schedule.

So, question for those who have been reading: What do you think of the topics? What make about changing things up? Have you ever had a time in life when you have wanted to change things up? What did you do about it?
