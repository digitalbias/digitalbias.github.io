This weekend I attended the 2018 BYU Career Boost. A one day seminar where students and alumni come together and learn things they can do to improve in their career as well as get tips on interviewing, leadership and networking. It was a great day and I thought I would share what I learned in the keynotes as well as the breakouts I attended.
