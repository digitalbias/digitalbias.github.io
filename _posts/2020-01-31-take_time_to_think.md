Taking time to think is something valuable, but something few of us take the time to actually do. About the only time we actually “think” is in the shower. It is the only time we don’t usually have some kind of electronic or distraction front and center. We are almost forced for a few minutes every day to take a time and pause while we clean ourselves. It is no wonder that people have great ideas while taking a shower. It is the only time their brain has time to engage in something where it is not actively problem solving or taking time to assimilate information. Only then, in the shower, are we being “forced” to take a break and allow the brain to make connections.

Time needs to be set aside every day to allow us the space to do this in a more deliberate way. People have touted the benefits of meditation, but there are any number of ways to meditate. At least in the way that I have seen it used.

In once case we still the mind and just focus on one thing, usually the breath or a certain point in space or our body. In this case we are trying to still the mind and exercise our ability to concentrate on a single thing or aspect. We identify distractions and by doing that our ability to refocus on the one thing we were concentrating becomes stronger.

In the other meaning of the word, we exert our concentration on a single thing, but in this case it is an idea, concept or a particular subject. We are focusing our mental energy to unlock a truth. The first exercise or meaning of the word “meditate” actually helps us with the second because the skill we develop in focusing on a particular object, like our breathing, can help us perform the necessary task of the second.

The fact is, we need time to do both. We need to set aside time to focus on both the skill of concentration and the skill of thinking deeply. Only then can we put together ideas and concepts without having to resort to “time in the shower.”
