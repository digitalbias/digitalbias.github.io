I used to be a terrible journal writer. 

If I did write, it was often just sporadic and lacked any kind of structure. Not that the lack of structure is a bad thing, I sometimes still do that, but I also felt like I needed to write something of a novel for each day. 

Now my journal entries are much better and I have a specific direction for what I write. With this system I have only missed a couple days since June 2011 because I have used the [Five Minute Journal][five_minute_journal] combined with [TextExpander] for helping add some consistency and automation to the process. Writing a journal entry has become an easy exercise. I admit that it takes longer than 5 minutes, but that’s still okay because I have added a few things to the original questions.

Here's how the system works.

### Overview

Every morning I fill out a simple questionnaire that helps me focus for the day and then every night I fill out another that helps me think about what I have done for the day. Add this practice to the next day planning and I have a good idea of what I should be working on for the day.  My shortcuts “;5am” and “;5pm” are easy to type and the fillable form makes it easy for me. I don’t have to remember what the questions are, I just have to write my responses. That makes it easier because then I can just focus on writing well thought out responses. 

### Details 

I open a blank text file, type my shortcut for the morning and then answer the questions. At the end of the day I open the same file, type the evening shortcut and answer the questions. Then I rename the file from “draft_journal.txt” to the date using another [TextExpander] shortcut which I named “;journal_filename”. It puts in the current date in with “journal” at the front of the file. 

I have another process on my computer called “Hazel” which takes that file and moves it to my journal archive, which is just a directory on my computer called “Journal” which has a folder under it for each month. If I ever want to see a particular entry I can go to that directory and find the month and then open the specific file in that folder. They are all text files so that makes it easy to use no matter what OS or device I am on. Everybody can read a text file.

The system has taken a while to perfect, but I can write a journal entry on my phone, tablet or my computer easily and that is the point. Making the journaling process simple has made it much easier to be consistent.
