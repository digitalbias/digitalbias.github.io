There are a number of tools I find I rely on throught out the day. My intention is to make a list of them and talk about the pros and cons for each one in a separate post. My hope is that by sharing my experience with each one, I can better see for myself why I like one tool over another and also share why I may or may not be considering moving to another tool.

So, the list:

* [Mac OS X/Mac Book Air][osx]
* [Sublime Text 3][sublime]
* [nvALT][nvalt]
* [Marked][marked]
* [Alfred][alfred]
* [GeekTool][geek]
* [1Password][pass]
* [Scrivener][scriv]
* [PlainText][text]
* [Ulysses/Daedalus][ulysses]
* [Things][things]
* [Total Terminal][total]
* [Homebrew][brew]
* [git][git]
* [ruby][ruby]
* [YNAB][ynab]
