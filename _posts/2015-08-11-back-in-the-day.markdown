So, back in the day I had a blog. It was on [http://blog.opencg.org][opencg] and I was running [MovableType][moveabletype] (when it was free). I made a backup of the site and I even put it on a CD and a hard drive. I don't know where those went. Frankly I'm not so sure I care either. That was a long time ago and some of that stuff would be interesting to go back and look at, but it's no longer what I'm about.

So, what am I about?

Good question. I've been asking myself that very same question now for almost two months and this is what I've discovered:

I really don't know.

Sort of. What I really mean is that while I have a lot of interests and there are a number of things I have done in the past, I still don't know what it is that is the major focus of what I want to do. And that is okay.

So, what do I want to do here, On this blog?

Mostly share some of the things I'm working on and if people are interested, great. If not, that's okay too. So...what am I working on?

Well, I was let go from my job about two months ago (June 4, 2015). Since that time I've taken the time and read [What Color is Your Parachute?][parachute], gone cliff jumping in Moab (and broke my ankle doing it), hiked to [Delicate Arch][arch] (the next day on said broken ankle), canoed the [Connecticut River][ct_river], rafted down the [Green River][green_river], hiked the [Boston Freedom Trail][freedom], camped in [Acadia National Park][acadia], started up/reconfigured this blog, hiked around [Devil's Tower][tower], camped in [Greenfield State Park][greenfield], joined [Fizzle][fizzle], and began working on a new project codenamed "Chorz".

I've enjoyed the time, and while summer is coming to a close, I can honestly say, I've had one fun-filled summer I'll never forget and could never have done if it hadn't been for getting let go from my full-time job.

So, what's next? Only time will tell, but whatever it is, I'm excited to find out where the ride takes me.
