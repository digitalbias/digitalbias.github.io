David Mitchell is a solid technical leader with experience in managing highly effective teams in completing projects on time, solving problems creatively, and following through on commitments while helping the team maintain a good work-life balance and high morale.

Using the [Clifton Strengths Finder][strengths], David's top five strenghts are:

- Responsibility 
    + "People who are especially talented in the Responsibility theme take psychological ownership of what they say they will do. They are committed to stable values such as honesty and loyalty."
- Discipline 
    + "People who are especially talented in the Discipline theme enjoy routine and structure. Their world is best described by the order they create."
- Learner 
    + "People who are especially talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. In particular, the process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them."
- Intellection 
    + "People who are especially talented in the Intellection theme are characterized by their intellectual activity. They are introspective and appreciate intellectual discussions."
- Deliberative
    + "People who are especially talented in the Deliberative theme are best described by the serious care they take in making decisions or choices. They anticipate the obstacles."

What does all that mean to you?

It means that when David makes a committment to you, he sticks with it. He is constantly looking for the best technology solutions for running a business. He evaluates it and picks the best solution for the task at hand. If he's wrong, he's willing to admit it and make corrections to his evaluations. You can trust him in his recommendations, and if he doesn't have a good solution, he'll tell you instead of leading you along.
