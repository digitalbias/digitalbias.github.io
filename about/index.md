My name is David Mitchell and I do freelance work under the business name of [Black Water Software][blackwater]. My specialty is in Ruby and Rails web application development, but I also have experience managing software development teams, setting up networks, servers and configuring a number of different software solutions. Lately my focus has shifted to helping small businesses navigate the quagmire of different IT solutions out there and help them get off on the right foot so they don't have to worry about the IT part of their business and instead can focus on serving their customers. 

Email subscribers receive posts a week earlier than those who are subscribed to the [RSS feed]({{site.url}}/feed.xml). You can also see [previous posts][posts] by clicking on the "posts" link above.

Using the [Clifton Strengths Finder][strengths], David's top five strenghts are:

- Responsibility 
    + "People who are especially talented in the Responsibility theme take psychological ownership of what they say they will do. They are committed to stable values such as honesty and loyalty."
- Discipline 
    + "People who are especially talented in the Discipline theme enjoy routine and structure. Their world is best described by the order they create."
- Learner 
    + "People who are especially talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. In particular, the process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them."
- Intellection 
    + "People who are especially talented in the Intellection theme are characterized by their intellectual activity. They are introspective and appreciate intellectual discussions."
- Deliberative
    + "People who are especially talented in the Deliberative theme are best described by the serious care they take in making decisions or choices. They anticipate the obstacles."
